  - "Weapons" (existing weapon functionality)  
  - "Combat Actions" (new combat-specific actions)

#### New Combat Action Buttons
- **First Aid**: Uses Healing skill, requires target within 2m (1 grid square), uses regeneration icon
- **Rally Other**: Uses Persuasion skill, requires target within 10m, uses upgrade icon
- **Rally Self**: Uses WIL attribute check, no target required, uses upgrade icon
- **Dodge**: Uses Evade skill, no target required, uses combat icon

#### Enhanced Weapon System

#### Advanced Targeting System
