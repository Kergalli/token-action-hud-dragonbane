## Required Modules
- [Token Action HUD Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud-core) is required for Token Action HUD Dragonbane to function.

## Next?
Currently this only supports Foundry V12 (up through build 343) and Token Action HUD Core 1.5.7. This was originally developed specifically for my home game. I'd like to add Foundry V13 and Token Action HUD Core 2.0+ support in the near future as well as some additional fuctionality.
